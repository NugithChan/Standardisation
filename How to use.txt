STANDARDISATION PROGRAM FOR THRESHOLD CALCULATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Here are some instructions  to follow:

1) The .exe file will be in the 'dist' folder. Make sure to make a text file with name 'stdthis' and type in all the data in any order.  After you have typed in all the data, type in the end of file ---->''end'' . MAKE SURE NOT TO LEAVE ANY SPACES OR ELSE PROGRAM MIGHT CRASH.(just to scare you lol)

eg:
90
89
87
86
85
34
57
87
10
11
69
42
0
end

2) Now run the .exe file.

3)Your results will be produced in another text file in the dist folder named 'stadardisationresults'. Open it and you will get the results! 


Don't worry... there are no keyloggers ,viruses , adware , or any other malicious software in this program.(If you really suspect me, run your antivirus on this program.)

That's all folks!   :)
